Hi, I'm Clayton!

I'm a data science engineer at [Methods Consultants](https://www.methodsconsultants.com), a sweet little data science and statistics consulting firm in Ypsilanti, Michigan.

I also co-organize the [Ann Arbor R User group](https://annarborrusergroup.github.io/), which last I checked is the most active RUG in Michigan!

**Likes**: R, machine learning, bad rap music

**Dislikes**: `for` loops, lactose, statistical software that starts with "S"
